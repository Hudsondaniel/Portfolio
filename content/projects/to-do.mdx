## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
```javascript
// Core Technologies
const techStack = {
    foundation: 'Vanilla JavaScript',
    bundling: 'Webpack 5',
    styling: 'CSS Modules',
    markup: 'Semantic HTML5'
};

// Key Features Implementation
class ProjectManager {
    constructor() {
        this.bindEvents();
        this.initializeUI();

    bindEvents() {
        // Dynamic event binding for real-time updates
        this.projectButton.addEventListener('click', this.createProject);
        this.taskContainer.addEventListener('change', this.handleTaskStatus);
    }

    createProject(event) {
        // Clean project creation with popup dialog
        const dialog = this.showProjectDialog();
        dialog.onSubmit(projectData => {
            this.projects.add(projectData);
            this.renderProjects();
        });
