## Technical Implementation

### Core Architecture
```javascript
// Game State Management
class BattleshipGame {
    constructor(difficulty = 'medium') {
        this.state = {
            playerBoard: new GameBoard(),
            computerBoard: new GameBoard(),
            currentPhase: GamePhase.SETUP,
            difficulty
        };
        
        this.ai = new AIController(difficulty);
        this.eventBus = new EventEmitter();
    }

    initialize() {
        // Setup game components
        this.setupBoards();
        this.bindEventListeners();
        this.startGame();
    }

    handleAttack(coordinates) {
        const result = this.processAttack(coordinates);
        this.updateGameState(result);
        
        if (this.isPlayerTurn && !this.isGameOver) {
            this.ai.calculateNextMove(this.state.playerBoard);
        }
    }
}

// AI Strategy Implementation
class AIController {
    constructor(difficulty) {
        this.difficulty = difficulty;
        this.hitStack = [];
        this.probabilityMap = new ProbabilityCalculator();
    }

    calculateNextMove(playerBoard) {
        if (this.hitStack.length > 0) {
            return this.targetAdjacentCells();
        }
        return this.probabilityMap.getOptimalTarget(playerBoard);
    }
}
```
